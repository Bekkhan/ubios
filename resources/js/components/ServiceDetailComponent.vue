                                    <p>The largest of these carriers, and the leader for the last century, is Maersk Line – the largest operating unit of A.P. Moller-Maersk, founded in 1904. Through over 115 years of logistics experience, Maersk Line now has offices in 115 countries worldwide and operates 590 container ships.</p>
                                    <p>Twill is an innovation of Maersk and we’re able to call on that 115 years of experience to best deliver for our customers – getting their freight on the best routes at the right price. With our instant rates, you get all costs upfront too, meaning there are no surprises when your cargo reaches its destination!</p>
                                    <p>But as you can imagine, getting all those containers across the sea takes some time. Exactly how long depends on various factors – including where you’re shipping it to and from and the type of shipment. There are several steps that goods go through before they reach a vessel and before they arrive at their destination. You can usually add a week’s time on either end of the process.</p>
                                    <p>At Twill we can help get you on the right route that will ensure your cargo reaches you as fast as possible.</p>

                                    <p>The land transport system plays a vital role in linking communities within a district and linking those communities with other districts and regions. As a physical resource of strategic importance, the land transport system needs to be managed, and protected from adverse effects (that may arise from land uses) that could affect the provision of an integrated, safe, responsive and sustainable land transport. Similarly, adverse environmental effects on land use activities resulting from land transport systems also need to be managed.</p>
                                    <p>Specific concerns in relation to land transport include:</p>
                                    <p>* increased reliance on single-occupant motor vehicle trips, and increased vehicle kilometres</p>
                                    <p>* declining future car use for certain groups (e.g. younger drivers) and the need for flexibility to enable the system to respond</p>
                                    <p>* growing congestion on the road network, and increased journey times</p>
                                    <p>* reduced ability for travel needs to be met by public transport and walking and cycling</p>
                                    <p>* reduced accessibility for older people and others in society who do not have a car or are unable to use one</p>
                                    <p>* ribbon and other dispersed development along arterial routes, with vehicles moving into and out of these developments, impeding the free flow of traffic, increasing the probability of crashes, and creating pressures for bypasses</p>
                                    <p>* incompatible land use and transport development (e.g. residents in new housing estates built alongside arterial routes opposing further development of the routes because of concerns about traffic noise and other environmental impacts).</p>

                                        Air freight parcel delivery is the transfer and shipment of goods via an air carrier, which may be charter or commercial. Such shipments travel out of commercial and passenger aviation gateways to anywhere planes can fly and land.

                                                Well, there are a few reasons – largely to do with capacity and cost. While air freight is often faster and a bit more reliable (as you’re not at the mercy of the sea!) it’s also more expensive – sometimes four or five times more expensive.

                                                Ocean freight takes more time, but it’s far cheaper and there are fewer restrictions on shipping hazardous cargo. On top of that, there’s much greater capacity for the price you pay. One container can hold 10,000 beer bottles for example!

                                                Ultimately, you want to pick the best route for your cargo – and when it comes to ocean freight, we can help. Choose Twill to get your ocean freight going.
